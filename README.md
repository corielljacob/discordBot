# discordBot
Discord bot I develop for a group of friends and myself to use.

Bot is built on Node.js has a list of handlers for responding to user inputs. 

This bot is being hosted on Azure (App Service).

The bot also makes use of a free MongoDB Atlas database. The access url is stored on heroku due to having sensitive login information. 

The bot can make use of images and other files included in this repo and those are typically stored in the assets folder.
