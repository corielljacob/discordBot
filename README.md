# discordBot
Personal discord bot with silly inside jokes between myself and girlfriend

Very basic framework designed for responding to user messages and replying to those messages in whatever channel they are sent in. 

This bot is being hosted on Heroku (currently for free as this is just a for-fun small project) -- the bots private key is stored on heroku 
thus you see " client.login(process.env.BOT_TOKEN); " in bot.js.
